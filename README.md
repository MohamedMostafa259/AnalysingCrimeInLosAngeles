# AnalysingCrimeInLosAngeles
This project focuses on analyzing crime data from Los Angeles to uncover patterns and trends. By exploring the dataset provided, we aim to identify crime frequency by hour, area, and victim demographics. The analysis includes visualizations of crime incidents over time, by month and day, as well as insights into victim age groups, sex, and descent.

## Motivation

Los Angeles, California ðŸ˜Ž. The City of Angels. Tinseltown. The Entertainment Capital of the World! 

Known for its warm weather, palm trees, sprawling coastline, and Hollywood, along with producing some of the most iconic films and songs. However, as with any highly populated city, it isn't always glamorous and there can be a large volume of crime. That's where we can help!

I've created this notebook to identify patterns in criminal behavior in Los Angeles.

## The Data

[DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/) published a single dataset to use. A summary and preview are provided below.

It is a modified version of the original data, which is publicly available from **Los Angeles Open Data**.
